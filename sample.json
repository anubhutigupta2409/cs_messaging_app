  "message": "Hi Branch...now my Application was rejected recently on 1st Feb 2017. I had borrowed Sh.25,000 in December 2015 of which I was slightly late in paying but I payed the whole loan today only to be dissapointed when I apply for another. It says I reapply again in 7days which is too long for me at the moment because I desperately need the cash. How can you assist?",
